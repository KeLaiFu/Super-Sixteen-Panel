PCB replacement panel for the excellent Super Sixteen sequencer from extralife instruments  (https://github.com/matthewcieplak/super-sixteen)

Button holes enlarged from 5mm to 6mm to suit the buttons I had at hand. Added the 'song' label to button 16 which is an additional feature added in a firmware update.

Designed to be used with white soldermask due to the transparent sections. White 5mm flat top LEDs are recomended. Black and other colors should work ok but may result in less illumination on the numbers.

Status: Built and tested.

Possible alterations / improvments: Plated holes could be used for the button apartures to prevent light bleed through the PCB. If I make another run of these I will apply this.
